### DB Schema & Firebase implementation

DB schema is built using Sqlite database to support followers feature and feeds. 
Three tables were created in order to pull the user's information and their followers; 
User, Follows and posts. 
Data collected from the User's and Follows table enables user to navigate to their profile page and be able to see posts of people they follow. 
For the posts feature, we implemented Firebase storage to stored user shared photos and for the user to be able to post to their profile.
